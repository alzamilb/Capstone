# Unusual Objects on the Road

## Environment
The environment for all four algorithms are set up for user to test dataset.

## Notes for run the best trained algorithm(RefineNet) with cityscapes model.
ssh and go to to username@steed.eecs.oregonstate.edu:~/scratch2/capstone32/caffe/refinenet/main
vim demo_refinenet_test_example_cityscapes.m and set the dataset dir as well as the dir for results will be stored. 
matlab -nodisplay
run demo_refinenet_test_example_cityscapes.m

## Dataset 
There are over 5000 images data we have already processed under OSU Steed server(username@steed.eecs.oregonstate.edu:~/scratch2/capstone32)
